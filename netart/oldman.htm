<h1>SCP 108</h1>
<p> This SCP is also known as the "Old Man." His appearance is of a humanoid with decayed skin and tattered clothing. He may stay dormant waiting for pray, but his presence should be known when a corrossive black mucus appears on floors, walls, or ceilings. He has the ability to move through walls and from one black mucus patch to another. If you step into one you will enter a pocket dimension similar to hell and you will die.   </p>
