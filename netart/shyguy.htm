<h1>SCP 096</h1>
<p> Also known as "Shy Guy," this 7 foot anomaly gets his name from it constantly covering his face and weeping. He is extremley thin and pale, but can reach unhuman speeds. If you look at him he will track you down and rip you limb from limb. It has been recorded that even if you look at a one by one pixel on an image that has SCP 096 in the background he will sense it and wreak havoc. He is heard weeping while docile but screaming when ravaging his prey. </p>
